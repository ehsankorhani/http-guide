Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. 

- designed for communication between web browsers and web servers
- follows a classical client-server model - client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response
- is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests
